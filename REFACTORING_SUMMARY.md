# Backend Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The backend codebase has been successfully refactored to implement proper separation of concerns and improve maintainability. The refactoring introduces a modular architecture that follows industry best practices for scalable applications.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Modular Architecture Implementation

**Before**: Single monolithic database service with all functionality in one file
**After**: Modular structure with distinct modules for each domain

```
packages/database/src/
├── modules/
│   ├── shared/           # Shared utilities and types
│   ├── users/           # User management
│   ├── leave-requests/  # Leave request management
│   ├── leave-balances/  # Leave balance management
│   ├── departments/     # Department management
│   ├── teams/          # Team management
│   ├── notifications/  # Notification management
│   ├── calendar-events/ # Calendar event management
│   ├── leave-policies/ # Leave policy management
│   ├── audit-logs/     # Audit logging
│   └── database-service.ts # Service factory
└── index.ts            # Main entry point
```

### 2. Layer Separation

Each module now follows a consistent three-layer architecture:

#### Types Layer (`types.ts`)
- TypeScript interfaces and DTOs
- Filter and query interfaces
- Domain-specific type definitions

#### Repository Layer (`repository.ts`)
- Database access operations
- CRUD operations
- Query building and execution
- Database-specific error handling

#### Service Layer (`service.ts`)
- Business logic implementation
- Cross-cutting concerns (audit logging, notifications)
- Validation and business rules
- Orchestration of operations

### 3. Shared Utilities

Created a shared module with common utilities:
- **DatabaseUtils**: Centralized error handling, query utilities, validation
- **Base Types**: Common interfaces for entities, pagination, filters
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error creation and handling

### 4. Service Factory Pattern

Implemented a service factory that:
- Manages service dependencies
- Provides singleton access to services
- Handles dependency injection
- Maintains loose coupling between modules

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling

- Centralized error handling with standardized error codes
- Detailed error context and logging
- Graceful error recovery
- Consistent error responses

### 6. Audit Logging Integration

- Automatic audit logging for all major operations
- User action tracking
- Resource-based logging
- Detailed operation context

## Modules Created

### 1. Users Module
- User CRUD operations
- Team member management
- User statistics
- Role-based operations

### 2. Leave Requests Module
- Leave request lifecycle management
- Approval/rejection workflow
- Team request management
- Bulk operations

### 3. Leave Balances Module
- Balance tracking by user and year
- Automatic balance updates
- Carry-over calculations
- Balance summaries

### 4. Departments Module
- Department CRUD operations
- Manager assignment
- Department statistics

### 5. Teams Module
- Team CRUD operations
- Team lead assignment
- Department-based organization

### 6. Notifications Module
- Notification CRUD operations
- Read/unread status management
- Notification types and templates

### 7. Calendar Events Module
- Event CRUD operations
- Date range queries
- Event type management
- User and department filtering

### 8. Leave Policies Module
- Policy CRUD operations
- Policy type management
- Active policy queries

### 9. Audit Logs Module
- Audit log creation
- User action tracking
- Resource-based logging
- Filtering and querying
